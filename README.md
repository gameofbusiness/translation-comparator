# Translation Comparator

# Why Use the Translation Comparator

If you have multiple different translations of the same text, so you cannot decide which translation is more accurate, then you can use the Translation Comparator to deconstruct each sentence into corresponding subparts so that you can then determine a consensus translation (with the Consensus Translator coming soon). 

# Getting Started

Requirement: Python

* Download translation-comparator.py

```
git clone https://github.com/gameofbusiness/Translation-Comparator.git
```

* Note the folder location so you can navigate to it in Terminal.
	* You can even copy-paste the Path Name if that makes it easier for you.

# How to Use the Translation Comparator

* Open Terminal (Linux/Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
* Navigate to folder containing translation-comparator.py
	* Syntax: cd <path name>
	* Example: cd Downloads
* Run Translation Comparator
	* Syntax: (python|python3) translation-comparator.py
	* Either python or python3 depending on which version of Python you have. 
		** If you know that you have installed Python on your computer, and you want to determine the version of Python that you have installed, open the Terminal app on your computer. Use the command "python --version" or "python -V". If neither of those work, they will return "command not found: python". Then use the command "python3 --version", adding the "3" after the "python" in the first word of the command. If that does not work, then re-install Python, and use the above commands to confirm the version of Python you have installed. 

# Example Output
